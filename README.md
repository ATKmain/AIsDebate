# AIsDebate Project README

## Introduction
Welcome to the AIsDebate Project! This Python-based project is designed to facilitate fascinating interactions between multiple AI Large Language Models (LLMs). By enabling these AI agents to converse, argue, and debate with each other, our goal is to compare their capabilities and strengths in various domains such as science, politics, and social sciences. The ultimate aim is to explore which LLM emerges as the most adept in argumentation and discussion.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Enables seamless interaction between different AI LLMs.
- **Topic Specific Debates**: Focus on various areas like science, politics, and social sciences.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate and compare the performance of each LLM in debates.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily add more AI models for comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ATKmain/AIsDebate.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AIsDebate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
To start a debate session between AI models:
```
python AIsDebate.py --topics "science, politics, social science"
```

## Configuration
- Edit `config.json` to add or remove AI models.
- Configure debate rules and scoring criteria in `settings.py`.
